# AcademicDemandForecast

**Description**  
This project aims to predict student academic performance to anticipate course demand for the upcoming academic cycle. By leveraging predictive analytics, the project seeks to optimize course offerings, improving resource allocation and meeting student needs effectively.

## Project Structure
- **`/data`**: Contains datasets used for model training and testing (not included in the repository).
- **`/scripts`**: Holds data processing and analysis scripts.
- **`/models`**: Stores trained models and related configurations.
- **`/notebooks`**: Jupyter Notebooks used for data exploration, model experimentation, and result visualization.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebooks**
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SmartPathAI/AcademicDemandForecast.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd AcademicDemandForecast
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
After setting up the environment, you can run the following steps to start working on the project:
1. **Data Preparation**: Place your datasets in the `/data` folder.
2. **Running Scripts**: Use scripts in `/scripts` for data preprocessing and model training.
3. **Exploration and Analysis**: Jupyter Notebooks in `/notebooks` provide initial analysis and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
4. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Train and evaluate models stored in the `/models` folder.
